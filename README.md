# COMSCI-2-MINI-DATA-SET
Student Test Scores – Mini Dataset
Project

Student Test Scores is a simple program that uses a 2D array to store and manage test scores of students in different subjects. It helps demonstrate how real-life school data can be organized and processed using arrays.

Overview

This project stores weekly test scores of students in a table-like structure using a 2D array. Each row represents a student, and each column represents a subject. The program allows accessing, updating, and summarizing the data.

Problem Statement

Teachers and students often need a simple way to organize and review test scores. Without proper structure, scores can be confusing and hard to manage. This project shows how a 2D array can organize student scores clearly and efficiently.

Objectives

Store student test scores using a 2D array

Access specific scores easily

Update scores when changes are needed

Calculate simple summaries like averages

Inputs
